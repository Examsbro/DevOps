Phase 1:To Do
-Objective: Identify and prioritize tasks or features to be developed.
-Key Actions:
o Define tasks clearly in a backlog.
o Prioritize tasks based on impact, urgency, and dependencies.
o Assign owners or teams to each task.
Tools: Jira, Trello, GitHub Issues, or Asana
Phase 2: In Progress
-Objective: Actively work on tasks selected from the "To Do" phase.
-Key Actions:
o Begin coding or configuring based on task requirements.
o Update the task status to reflect ongoing work.
o Ensure team members collaborate effectively (e.g., stand-ups, pair programming).
Best Practices:
 Use branches in version control systems for individual tasks (e.g., Git feature branches).
 Write unit tests alongside development.
Phase 3: Code Review
 Objective: Validate the quality, functionality, and security of the code.
 Key Actions:
o Submit pull requests for peer review.
o Review code for adherence to standards, logic, and potential issues.
o Approve or request changes.
Tools: GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests, Bitbucket.
Automation: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically during reviews.
Phase 4: Done
 Objective: Mark tasks as completed and deploy changes if necessary.
 Key Actions:
o Merge the approved code into the main branch.
o Deploy to staging or production environments.
o Monitor deployment and validate functionality.
Post-Completion:
 Add documentation for the changes.
 Gather feedback from stakeholders or users.
Workflow Visualization
A Kanban board or similar visual representation can help track the status of tasks across these phases. For example:
1. To Do: Contains all pending tasks.
2. In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
3. Code Review: Tasks awaiting review or approval.
4. Done: Completed and deployed tasks.
Tools:
Trello, Jira, Azure.
